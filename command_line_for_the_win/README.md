# Command Line for the Win
For this project, I completed the [Command line for the win](https://cmdchallenge.com/) Each file is a PNG screenshot signifying my completion of all levels.

* `command line for win` is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!
