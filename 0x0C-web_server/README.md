# Automating Server Configuration with Bash Scripts

This project focuses on automating server configuration tasks using Bash scripts. By understanding the concepts of child processes, web servers, and DNS, you will create scripts that configure an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS machine to meet specific requirements. This automation not only helps in avoiding repetitive manual tasks but also enhances your skills as a Software Engineer.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain the main role of a web server
- Define what a child process is and its significance
- Understand why web servers use parent and child processes
- Identify the main types of HTTP requests
- Describe the purpose and role of DNS
- Recognize different DNS record types and their uses

## Project Requirements

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Platform: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Files: All files should end with a new line
- README.md: A mandatory project readme file
- Bash Scripts: All scripts must be executable
- Shellcheck: Scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without errors
- Script Header: Scripts should start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and include a comment explaining their purpose
- No `systemctl`: Avoid using systemctl for process restarting
